        <p>I have lived in Melbourne for most of my life, apart from the year I lived in Perth in 2007 and 2008. I started primary school in Perth at Highgate Primary School, before moving back to Melbourne and going to Bentleigh West Primary School. I then went to Brighton Secondary College, graduating in 2020, before commencing at RMIT in 2021. </p>

      <h3>subheading</h3>
        <p>I started playing basketball when I was about 6 and have been playing ever since. In 2014, I started playing representative basketball for the Oakleigh Warriors, who I played 4 seasons with, until 2017. I also played one rep season with Port Phillip in 2018. Currently I play in 3 teams, one in under 23s and two in womenâ€™s open grades, as well as training to become a referee. In the NBA I support the Chicago Bulls, and in the WNBA I support the Washington Mystics, who I was lucky enough to see play in 2017 at the Staples Centre against the Los Angeles Sparks. </p>

      <h3>subheading</h3>
        <p>My family consists of my mum, Kelly, my dad, Rob, and my younger sister, Remi. We also have two toy poodles, Maddy and Malibu. </p>

        <p>My favourite thing to do is travel. I love going on overseas trips especially and exploring the world. My family go on international holidays annually, which was unfortunately disrupted by COVID last year. In 2018 I was lucky enough to attend a World Challenge expedition to India and Nepal with a group of kids from my school, entirely funded by ourselves. The trip was my first overseas without my family, and a fun challenge which we controlled and coordinated ourselves. Trekking the Annapurna Base Camp was definitely a highlight.  I had planned a trip to travel all over Europe with my best friend this year, however due to COVID we have had to postpone it to a future date. </p>
