      <p>I have lived in Melbourne for most of my life, apart from the year I lived in Perth in 2007 and 2008. I started primary school in Perth at Highgate Primary School, before moving back to Melbourne and going to Bentleigh West Primary School. I then went to Brighton Secondary College, graduating in 2020, before commencing at RMIT in 2021. </p>
