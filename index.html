      <p>I have lived in Melbourne for most of my life, apart from the year I lived in Perth in 2007 and 2008.<br>I started primary school in Perth at Highgate Primary School, before moving back to Melbourne <br>and going to Bentleigh West Primary School. I then went to Brighton Secondary College, graduating <br>in 2020, before commencing at RMIT in 2021. </p>

      <p>I started playing basketball when I was about 6 and have been playing ever since. In 2014, I started <br>playing representative basketball for the Oakleigh Warriors, who I played 4 seasons with, until 2017. <br>I also played one rep season with Port Phillip in 2018. Currently I play in 3 teams, one in <br>under 23s and two in womenâ€™s open grades, as well as training to become a referee. <br>In the NBA I support the Chicago Bulls, and in the WNBA I support the Washington Mystics, who I was lucky enough to see play in 2017 at the Staples Centre against the Los Angeles Sparks. </p>
