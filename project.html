    <div class="panel">
      <p>The plan for my project is to incorporate smart technology and computer vision into your average fridge to create an appliance which will make grocery shopping 10 times easier.  The technology will realise when an item is missing from the fridge and remind the user that they need to restock by sending an alert to their mobile phone and creating a virtual and easy to access shopping list within an app. The plan is to eradicate the irritation caused when an item that is so desperately wanted is no longer in the fridge and at the user’s dispense. </p>

    <button class="accordion", font-face="monaco">Motivation</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>How frustrating is it when you go to the fridge and there’s no milk? My idea plans to eliminate the frustration, by sending an alert to the user’s phone and creating a virtual shopping list. Most people don’t go anywhere without their phones, so it will be hard to lose the list or forget to take it to the store AND the items are automatically added without you even realising you have run out of something. Perfect! Hopefully thanks to this invention, the frustration felt when there is no milk will be no more!</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion", font-face="monaco">Description</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The idea for my project is to implement technology into a fridge which uses Artificial Intelligence to sense what items are in the fridge and what need to be restocked on, sending an alert to a virtual shopping list. Having the technology determine what is needed to be purchased and adding it to the users shopping list, helps prevent them from forgetting a necessary item, or not knowing that they have ran out of something. The aim is to make grocery shopping easier by saving the user time, as they wouldn’t need to rummage around to see if they need something, or unknowingly have ran out of an everyday staple.<br>
Many people have already started using lists on their smart devices to remember what they need to do or buy, so having technology which can automatically add to the list when something is missing in the fridge is a game changer. Not only will it save the user time, but it will also ensure that the user always has what they need. 99.8% of Americans own at least one fridge, meaning this technology could become very popular as it would be affecting and helping nearly everyone. I think this implementation would be very useful, as I know from personal experiences that everyone forgets an item when they are grocery shopping, because they forgot to write it down, or didn’t know they ran out of milk! <br> In this day and age, people are always looking to get the newest and “techiest” thing available on the market, and this would sure be up there, incorporating the software’s used in Artificial Intelligence to make daily life easier. My idea came from the “Amazon Go” stores across the United States, which feature walk in walk out grocery shopping. The stores use technology including computer vision and sensor fusion to detect what a shopper has picked up and taken, adding it to an itemised receipt which will be sent to them and charged to their Amazon account. The technology used is similar to that which is used in self driving cars, to recognise what is being picked up and put back. It would allow items to be identified as they are put into the fridge or when removed, and if not replaced in a certain period of time, will be added straight onto the shopping list in the user’s pocket, ready to be taken to the store. Putting this into a fridge, or even a pantry would act the same way to Amazon Go stores work, where instead of sending an itemised receipt, it would send a list of what needs to be purchased. This idea is basically the future of appliances and would be in high demand due to the smart features applied to it by the AI, and the ability to make day to day life easier. It would also be easily accessible for users, even those not too tech savvy, as all that would be needed is an app downloaded onto their smart phone and connected to the fridge with some sort of code or key.

    <button class="accordion", font-face="monaco">Tools and Technologies</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>This project would incorporate the Artificial Intelligence and technology used to function self-driving cars to determine and track where items are. Things like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and sensor fusion can be used to locate items, which can then recognise when an item leaves and returns to the fridge. For example if someone were to remove the milk to use in a coffee, and doesn’t put in back in because the carton is empty. The technology will acknowledge it is no longer there and send an alert saying, “you need milk”. Tools such as app and web developers will also be fundamental to set up the software side and turn a “teched up” fridge, into something that can improve one’s daily chore. </p>

    <button class="accordion", font-face="monaco">Skills Required</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The execution of this project would require a project manager to plan and control the creation of my product. This would require high communication skills and someone who is good with deadlines. Web development skills would also be essential as well as UX design as a clean and efficient application will be necessary to send the alerts to and create the virtual shopping list. Skills relating to the putting together of hardware is also crucial in order to actually produce the physical product, being the fridge with incorporated AI abilities. Without the hardware skills, the product is basically non-existent as it relies on the physical fridge. </p>

    <button class="accordion", font-face="monaco">Outcome</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>This implementation of Artificial Intelligence into a fridge, or pantry for that matter would have a positive impact within homes, as necessary items will nearly always be stocked up and available for households to consume. This is due to the sensors detecting when something needs to be replenished, ensuring users will be able to access everyday items every day. It will hopefully lead to the elimination of forgetting to purchase items, unknowingly not having staples, resulting in the eradication of multiple grocery trips. </p>
