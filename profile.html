<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<p>I undertook the Myers Briggs Type Indicator Test, the Learning Styles Test and the Leadership test in order to evaluate my potential performance in team situations.</p>

<h3>Myers Briggs Type Indicator Test</h3>

  <div class="overlay">The Protagonist (EFNJ-T)</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> ENFJ-T (The Protagonist)</p>
<p>I was surprised by the results of my Myers Briggs Type Indicator Test (MBTI) as I would personally classify myself as an introvert. However, after reading into the difference between introverts and extraverts, I have realised that it is not solely based on how an individual acts around people, but also the environments and situations they find themselves in. </p>

<h3>Learning Styles Test</h3>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Mostly Pragmatist Style</p>
<p>To be completely honest, I did not even know what pragmatism was until I took this test, however now knowing the definition I can confirm that I do take a practical approach to my learning. I like to learn through trial and error, using problem solving to better my understanding of a subject. </p>

<h3>Ledership Test</h3>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Transformative Leader</p>
<p>After learning about the characteristics of a transformative leader, I feel like this style fits me well, as I would want to be a part of a team with this structure. Transformative leaders encourage members to create change and constantly improve themselves by giving them space for innovation to create solutions for future problems. </p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>Both the MBTI and the Leadership tests have indicated to me that I am very much a team player and would much rather work in a collaborative manner than individually. I agree with these results to a significant extent as I like to have people who I can share my ideas with and hear their own ideas and opinions, creating a positive attitude towards team related work. I think it is important, especially in a rapidly growing field such as IT, to have other people you can bounce thoughts and ideas off to create the ultimate outcome and solutions you can.  </p>
